"""
HTMX-driven Sales Invoice module.

This package provides a set of models, services, views and templates to
create and manage sales invoices using a fully server-side HTMX pattern.
Unlike the existing accounting module which relies heavily on complex
client‑side JavaScript, this module implements all business logic on the
server while using small HTMX interactions for a responsive user
experience.
