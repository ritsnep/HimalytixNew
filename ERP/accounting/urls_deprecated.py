# Deprecated duplicate URL module.
# The project now uses the package `accounting/urls/` (i.e. `accounting.urls` package) as the canonical
# source of URL patterns. This file used to contain URL patterns but that caused duplication and
# ambiguity because the `accounting/urls/` package also exists.
#
# Keep this file as a read-only record for now. Do NOT include it in Django's URL configuration.
# You can safely delete this file after verifying everything works with the `accounting/urls` package.

# NOTE: This file intentionally left as a deprecated shim. See `accounting/urls/__init__.py`.
